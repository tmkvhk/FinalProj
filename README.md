## Variables and Constants

### Declaring Variables
Learn how to declare and use variables in Swift.

```swift
var age = 25

### variables-and-constants
In Swift, you can declare variables using the `var` keyword. Variables are mutable, meaning their values can be changed after declaration.

```swift
var age = 25
var temperature: Double = 22.5
var name: String = "John"
